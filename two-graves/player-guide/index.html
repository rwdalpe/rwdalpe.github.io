    Here you will find information about Seorsus and its major settlments that any 
    individual who lives in or has briefly researched the nation would know. Feel free to use 
    these sections to help build your characters and integrate them into the world. 
  </p><div id="R.1.2.3" class="mediaobject full-image"><table border="0" summary="Manufactured viewport for HTML image" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td><object data="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7b9uMyuu5dvVzRwUEhMSEo4NWs" type="image/svg+xml" width="100%"></object></td></tr></table></div><p>
    Seorsus was founded roughly 450 years ago when crusaders from a temple of
    Abadar in Folda embarked on a mission to colonize the region. They swore a 
    holy oath that the new nation would be an exemplar of civilization and glory for centuries to 
    come. At that moment, they created the Founders and dedicated themselves to the cause of
    sharing this glory with the world. To that end, they established a means of constructing and
    linking Thresholds—magical gates which can be used to travel to and from Seorsus.
    Immigrants to the new nation were slow to come at first, but they did arrive. And as they 
    arrived, they founded successful new lives in the bountiful valley of Multae. Word 
    spread, and the population of Seorsus grew exponentially as people from all over the 
    continent came to investigate this new wonder and found their expectations exceeded. It was 
    not long before the fledgling nation became the hub of luxury, trade, and travel that it is 
    today.
  </p><section id="R.1.2.5" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>Modern Life in Seorsus</h3></header><p>
    In the heart of the valley of Multae, protected by the forboding Devil's Tail Mountains to 
    the north and the unfathomable Great Rift to the south, Seorsus echoes with 
    a clarion call of opportunity. Low, rolling hills stretch across the
    landscape, and lush green forests intermingle with networks of towns and villages. 
    Occasionally, gleaming cities sit at the center of these networks, marking the terrain
    with intricate webs of road that connect settlements for miles around. Along the 
    foothills, frontier towns dot lands carved with snow-melt rivers that
    flow from the peaks above to empty into the Clearlake.
  </p><p>
    The abundance of the valley may provide, but ultimately the people of Seorsus are its 
    lifeblood. Most citizens live and work in ostensibly simple villages, where they develop
    arable land and pull forth rich resources from the valley's mines. Their harvests flow
    inward toward the cities of the nation, where they supply insatiable craftsmen and 
    merchants who give Seorsus its reputation as an economic and cultural superpower. In 
    return, the inner settlements provide ample public works, education, infrastructure, and other
    resources that allow the outland residents to specialize and thrive. All the while, brave
    and resourceful frontiersmen pave the way for others to follow in their footsteps and expand 
    the glory of the nation.
  </p></section><section id="R.1.2.6" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>Religion in Seorsus</h3></header><p>
    Seorsus was founded as part of an Abadarian religious crusade, and its roots are still 
    apparent to this day. Although the nation is not strictly aligned with any one deity, its 
    senate is composed of eighteen representatives from the most influential temples—be it
    influence through number of worshipers, wealth, or other means. Currently the temples of 
    Abadar, Shelyn, Cayden Cailean, Sarenrae, Pharasma, Iomedae, and Erastil hold senate 
    positions. The temple of Abadar has maintained major power in the city, and from the gilded
    halls of The First Capitol in Regunt it oversees much of the nation's financial and legal
    well-being. Shelyn and Cayden Cailean both have large followings in Oblectant, and their 
    temples—Couatl's Voice and The Best Vault—draw tourists and worshippers from
    far and wide.
  </p><div class="sidebar"><header class="sidebar-titlepage"><h4>Mystery of the Shrines</h4></header><div class="sidebar-content"><p>
      Scattered around the landscape of Seorsus are mysterious shrines.
      The shrines wield various potent magics, from healing, to increased 
      strength and speed, to the ability to breath underwater for a time.
      Although the purpose and origin of these shrines is contested fact, 
      access to them is highly valued, and many groups vie for stewardship of
      these relics.
    </p></div></div><p>
    Iomedae's temple is the Praesidium in Regunt and much of the police force are devotees.
    Sarenrae, Pharasma, and Erastil enjoy large popular support from all around the nation for
    their public services and good works, but they do not maintain large shrines or temples in
    any one location. Many other faiths have worshippers in Seorsus, and although they do 
    not hold prominent political power, Desna, Gozreh, Calistria, and Irori all have noteworthy 
    followings in various places around the country.
  </p></section><section id="R.1.2.7" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>The Government of Seorsus</h3></header><p>
    Outwardly, the government of Seorsus is composed of three parts: an Emperor, a Senate,
    and District Representatives. The Emperor is an elected official rather than a supreme ruler. There is no term
    limit for an Emperor, but most choose to rule for twenty to twenty five years before stepping
    down. The Emperor holds the power to veto laws, act as the commander of the National Police Force, and
    resolve tie votes in the Senate. The current Emperor is Marshall Blackwood.
  </p><p>
    The Senate comprises eighteen leaders chosen from and by the
    nation's eminent temples, with each temple holding a number of positions corresponding 
    to their influence. Senators are solely responsible for ratifying laws, and they also have 
    the power to call for an immediate re-election of the Emperor. District Representatives are officials elected
    every four years by the citizens of their districts. Legally, the District Representatives have only three 
    powers: they elect the Emperor from one of their own; they are the only citizens, besides the
    Emperor, permitted to directly address a meeting of the Senate; and they may vote to forcibly
    remove Senators from office for life.
  </p><div class="sidebar"><header class="sidebar-titlepage"><h4>Who's in the Senate?</h4></header><div class="sidebar-content"><p>
      Currently, the temple of Abadar is allocated eight senate seats. Shelyn holds three, and
      Sarenrae and Cayden Cailean each hold two. Pharasma, Iomedae, and Erastil are all 
      represented, but each holds only one seat.
    </p></div></div><p>
    In practice, of course, the government is much more than just the sum of its leadership. Of the various 
    agencies and divisions that constitute the government, the largest
    and most publicly visible are the National Police Force, the Department of Customs and Immigration, and the Public Works Agency. The National Police Force 
    is charged with maintaining peace and safety 
    throughout the nation, and is the closest thing Seorsus has to a military force. The current 
    head of police, Nigel Croft, continues to uphold the organization's
    excellent reputation. Although he may claim that they are chronicly understaffed and underfunded, 
    Seorsus is an incredibly safe country. The Department of Customs and Immigration controls and maintains the magical gates
    that lead to Seorsus, and are also responsible for levying taxes on exported goods. The Public Works Agency
    builds and maintains infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and waterways, and also settles disputes over
    public lands, most frequently regarding the ancient relics scattered about the country.
  </p></section><section id="R.1.2.8" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>The Central Cities</h3></header><p>
    The Central Cities are the largest urban centers in Seorsus. They
    represent the peak of culture and progress in the nation, and each of
    them has developed their own unique culture and specialties over time.
  </p><div class="sidebar"><header class="sidebar-titlepage"><h4>Common Government Resources</h4></header><div class="sidebar-content"><p>
      Although they may not be specifically called out in these sections, you
      can expect most government agencies that deal with infrastructure to 
      have representation in all large settlements. This includes, but is not
      limited to, divisions such as the National Police Force, Public Works Agency, and other 
      servants of the common good.
    </p></div></div><section id="R.1.2.8.4" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Oblectant, City of Arts</h4></header><p>
      Brimming with life and activity, the city of Oblectant is the 
      veritable pulse of Seorsus. Artists and entertainers from all 
      walks of life flock to the city to join in the cultural melting pot and
      experience the wealth Oblectant has to offer. Anywhere is a stage, and
      revelry spills out into the streets, infusing the city with a constant 
      state of festivity. Each day could bring new celebrations replete with 
      performances and displays unlike any seen before it. As a result, 
      Oblectant is a hot spot for tourists from around the world, and their
      presence ensures that there is plenty of gold to keep the entertainers
      at their antics. 
    </p><div id="R.1.2.8.4.3" class="mediaobject half-image"><table border="0" summary="Manufactured viewport for HTML image" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td><object data="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7b9uMyuu5dvNDZRUk5fSk1ZaGM" type="image/svg+xml" width="100%"></object></td></tr></table></div><p>
      Officials long gave up on imposing bureaucracy upon the citizens, and 
      now simply seek to ensure that the city runs smoothly from one 
      performance to the next. The last vestige of control the government 
      maintains over the celebrations is the Festival Planning Committee, which 
      stages city-wide festivals, schedules access to large venues such as 
      Lavender Fields, and provides publicity for ambitious performers. The National Police Force 
      patrols the streets, keeping the city safe for residents and tourists 
      alike, but their presence is understated and does not impinge on the 
      city's carefree atmosphere. Petty crime is uncommon, and offenders are 
      swiftly swept to the nearest police station or courthouse for judgement.
    </p><p>
      Despite the apparent laissez-faire attitude of the government,
      Oblectant is extremely well-maintained. Buildings of sturdy wood and
      cut stone stand strong against the neverending flow of residents, and
      paved streets make for easy transport around the city. Lights both
      magical and mundane line the streets and buildings, vying for the 
      attention of passersby. Even with messy tourists who care not for the 
      city's cleanliness, strong sewers and trash removal systems sweep away 
      the filth and leave the city ready for the festivities to continue.
    </p><section id="R.1.2.8.4.6" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h5>Places of Interest</h5></header><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Dragon's Teeth</span></dt><dd><p>
              Rows of enormous amethyst crystals jutting from the entrance 
              give Oblectant's premier amphitheater it's name. Although its 
              appearance and sublime acoustics would suggest a man-made 
              structure, Dragon's Teeth is actually a naturally occurring
              geode phenomenon. Performing even once in the Dragon's Teeth is 
              the goal of many artists, and competition is fierce. The revered
              Auditioners are the final elite arbiters of who will be graced
              by the stage.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Couatl's Voice</span></dt><dd><p>
              Vivid botanical gardens and serene marble galleries compose the
              nation's premier temple of Shelyn. The temple is built on the 
              edge of the city and situated near the Dragon's Teeth so that the 
              clergy may more easily tend to the amphitheater. Compared to the 
              intensity of the city, Couatl's Voice is truly a sanctuary for 
              those who wish to reflect upon the spiritual impact of the arts. 
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Bell University</span></dt><dd><p>
              Bell University is one of the world's most prestigious schools for 
              the fine arts, and a central location for both prospective students
              and tourists alike. Although its intimidating spires, sharply slanted
              rooftops, and aged stone walls cast an imposing shadow, they belie
              the energy within. Its campus buzzes jovially at all hours of the 
              day as some of the greatest creative geniuses from around the 
              globe hone their skills.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Lavender Fields</span></dt><dd><p>
              Named for the carpet of small purple flowers that blooms in the 
              spring, the Lavender Fields is an expansive, open-air park and a prime
              location for many public events. Complete with several small 
              venues for performances as well as a large stadium, the 
              Lavender Fields boasts ample space and seating for tourists and citizens
              alike. Whether it be music, sports, or festivals, an event in the
              Lavender Fields is sure to be lively and draw a large crowd.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Bridge</span></dt><dd><p>
              Spanning the Limen River and joining the east and west
              of Oblectant together, the Bridge is more than just an 
              important piece of infrastructure. Many bits of Oblectant 
              culture have incoporated the Bridge, from tossing flowers into 
              the river below for good luck to being a hotspot for watching
              fireworks. More practically, it's also a natural chokepoint for 
              traffic through the city and its wide stone path is filled with 
              street performers, each trying to take advantage of their captive 
              audiences.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">The Best Vault</span></dt><dd><p>
              A large stone carving of a frothing mug adorns the facade of
              Oblectant's favorite temple to the god of drinking and 
              merriment. This multi-story wood and stone building radiates a 
              warmth and festivity that can be felt from blocks away. The temple 
              hosts a stage and doubles as both a comedy house and theater for 
              celebrations of bravey, and its walls reverberate with laughter
              and cheers. To the confusion of tourists and the amusement of 
              locals, the interior of the temple is themed as a bank.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Plaza District</span></dt><dd><p>
              Surrounding Oblectant's central plazas, this bustling
              district is a hotspot for tourism and revelry. Although
              most come to the district to be at the center of the 
              city's constant festivals, the competition between 
              enterprises to garner attention has changed the district 
              into a spectacle in its own right. Themed businesses, 
              wild street performers, and garish decorations all lend a
              hand in creating the district's unique atmosphere.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">College District</span></dt><dd><p>
              Fed by the youthful, creative energies of the
              Bell University, the College District is the
              premiere place to scout rising talent and share ideas in
              the city. Although not as upscale as some parts of 
              Oblectant, the inhabitants of the district are jovial
              and create a welcoming atmosphere. Collaboration and
              competition go hand-in-hand here, and it's very likely to
              see spontaneous performances erupt in the persuit of great
              art.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Garden District</span></dt><dd><p>
              Mostly separated from the hustle and bustle of the city,
              the Garden District provides a serene place for
              those who can afford it. Residents and visitors enjoy
              beautiful courtyards, spotless streets, and exclusively 
              close access to iconic locations such as Dragon's Teeth 
              and Couatl's Voice.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Barrelbottom District</span></dt><dd><p>
              To call Barrelbottom District a slum would be 
              disingenuous, but compared to the rest of Oblectant 
              this district falls behind in upkeep and cleanliness.
              Tenement housing is plentiful, and in lieu of access to
              more fanciful pursuits, the residents of
              Barrelbottom District excel in vice entertainment.
              Seedy bars and brothels adorn the streets, and the venues
              host bawdy and burlesque performances too vulgar for
              popular taste.

              Tucked away in a less-noticeable portion of the city,
              Warehouse District houses offices and storage 
              for government agencies such as the National Police Force and
              Festival Planning Committee.

              Many master craftsmen who outfit Oblectant with 
              superior quality instruments and supplies base their
              workshops in Masters District. These great 
              makers demand a particular environment for their work, and
              the district has molded to reflect their tastes. Simple, 
              refined architecture and narrow cobbled streets give the 
              district a historic atmosphere, and even the wildest of 
              locals calm themselves out of respect when in the area. 
            </p></dd></dl></div></section></section><section id="R.1.2.8.5" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Crent, City of Markets</h4></header><p>
      Words and noise blend with the clink of coins in the vibrant market city
      of Crent. Known for its unparalleled selection of exotic goods,
      which harken both to cultures from around the world and at the same time
      something completely original, Crent is a haven for craftsmen.
      The best of the best travel here to study with other masters from all
      around. The result is a forge of rivalries and collaborations which
      drive the innovations of these ambitious creators ever foward. Their work
      and success have brought incredibly reknown to  both Crent and the
      nation as a whole, and wealth naturally flows to the city in the form of 
      hardened merchants and more casual buyers.
    </p><p>
      The siren call of wealth and skill brings along with it much more strict
      government oversight. Left to their own devices, foreign merchants would
      surely bleed the country dry. In response, agencies such as the Department of Customs and Immigration and
      the Department of Labor keep close watch on the conditions of the city. Given
      the amount of coin that flows through the streets, the National Police Force are
      omnipresent in Crent, ensuring that the city retains its name as a
      safe and reputable haven for trade. 
    </p><div id="R.1.2.8.5.4" class="mediaobject half-image"><table border="0" summary="Manufactured viewport for HTML image" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td><object data="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7b9uMyuu5dvR3FwWEt6bW5UNmc" type="image/svg+xml" width="100%"></object></td></tr></table></div><p>
      The master craftsmen themselves are no pushovers either. Crafting guilds
      are strictly forbidden both in a legal sense and a communal one, as each
      individual crafter vies for the reputation of her own name. Consequently,
      mutual respect—even among the most obvious of rivals—is 
      paramount and palpable in the transactions that take place here.
    </p><p>
      To feed the high demand of buyers, Crent has built itself up 
      around a system of attractive and efficient roads and neighborhoods.
      No space is wasted in thoroughfares large or small, as every bit of
      available wall space is transformed into a storefront or workshop. Sturdy stone
      buildings resist wear from unending shoppers, but also from nature's harshness
      and the occasional workshop fire. Goods transit smoothly through the 
      city's wide, paved streets, their navigation made easy by numerous road 
      markers. At night, hanging iron lamps illuminate the city's famous 
      twenty-four hour markets.

              Thousands of shoppers browse the rows of tents 
              that fill this enormous open-air market. As one of 
              Crent's internationally iconic features, the 
              Grand Bazaar is home to all sorts of novelties and
              unique items. Although locally regarded as more for show
              than function, it is not unheard of to find true treasures
              nestled in the wares here. 
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">House of Commerce</span></dt><dd><p>
              Dozens of imposing wooden boards line the walls of this
              large forum, each filled with statistics and
              predictions for various market goods. Harried merchant 
              apprentices hustle along the walls with tablets and chalk
              in an unending effort to keep the boards up to date.
              Meanwhile, cold-faced merchants and crafters eye the ever
              changing boards like vipers ready to strike.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Nascereli</span></dt><dd><p>
              Nascereli is Seorsus's largest single home of 
              elves. Here they have fostered a small forest grove and 
              made their homes in its trunks and boughs. Elves, 
              Half-Elves, and fey races are openly welcomed, but most 
              others find themselves loosely tolerated as permanent 
              residents.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Khurulag</span></dt><dd><p>
              Not to be outdone by the forest of Nascereli
              or the cut stone of Crent itself, the Dwarves
              constructed a miniature mountainscape out of boulders
              from the nation's mines. Now complete with carved
              homes and bold designs, Khurulag is a colony in
              its own right. Although legally no citizen may be 
              forbidden residence here, most non-Dwarves find the stony,
              cramped interior unwelcoming.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Lakeside Harbor</span></dt><dd><p>
              Cargo boats fill the numerous docks of this large
              harbor on the Clearlake. Much of Crent's imports
              and exports pass through this harbor, and deckhands work 
              feverishly to keep the flow of goods moving. 
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Limen River Customs</span></dt><dd><p>
              Owned by the Department of Customs and Immigration, this customs house sits
              on an island in the Limen River just before
              it passes through the city. Ships queue up to have their 
              cargo inspected and their paperwork approved by the 
              grim-faced and serious officials who work here.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">The Heights</span></dt><dd><p>
              Perched atop the highest hill of Crent's 
              lakeshore, The Heights houses the 
              wealthiest citizens and dignitaries of the city. 
              A stunning lakeside vista complements the opulent 
              estates here, and the city's most reputable envoys traverse 
              the boulevards on business for their employers.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Coin District</span></dt><dd><p>
              The Coin District is home to the majority
              of Crent's storefronts and markets, and is the
              city's largest and most famous district. From small 
              one-man storefronts to the Grand Bazaar itself, the
              Coin District encompasses trade of all
              sizes and types.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Workshop District</span></dt><dd><p>
              Strategically located between the Lakeside Harbor
              and the storefronts of Coin District,
              the Workshop District provides for makers
              who require larger, more complex facilities. The sounds of
              creation clamour forth from the district's workshops and 
              forges as each crafter develops his next masterpiece. 
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">North District</span></dt><dd><p>
              North District provides accommodation
              for those residents who do not live in their stores or
              workshops, and those visitors who choose not to pay the
              premiums of inns in the Coin District. 
              Although they are not the gilded estates of 
              The Heights, the homes and buildings in
              this district are by no means in shambles. Even the 
              simplest housing in Crent reflects the city's
              wealth and high standards of living.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Operations District</span></dt><dd><p>
              Home to the offices of information brokers, merchant guild 
              members, and government officials, the 
              Operations District hosts the unseen web of 
              data and law that keeps the city running. Through word of
              mouth and fleet couriers, information and orders rush from
              this district to recipients within and beyond Crent's
              borders.
            </p></dd></dl></div></section></section><section id="R.1.2.8.6" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Regunt, City of Laws</h4></header><p>
      At the heart of Seorsus is the nation's crown jewel: the
      capital city of Regunt. Towering, gleaming buildings of marble
      and polished stone strike a grand vista for those who first
      lay eyes upon the city. Impressive grids of streets and avenues 
      bustle with activity, feeding the machine that runs the nation.
      At night, although the streets die down to dim illumination by
      heavy iron lamps, the work of the city does not cease. Buildings
      big and small come to life as interior lights shine through their
      windows, offering tantalizing hints at the ongoings within.
    </p><p>
      From first sight to last, Regunt whisks away newcomers and 
      locals alike into an embrace of structure and control that seems 
      almost caring. The city runs like clockwork, with each inhabitant 
      and agency fulfilling a purpose in a timely and efficient manner. 
      From the lowliest courier to the highest seats of government, 
      every citizen of Regunt is devoted fully to their cause. To do
      otherwise would be to invite certain scorn and disdain from one's 
      peers.
    </p><p>
      Just as each citizen is devoted to their tasks, so is the city itself
      devoted to the law. Law is born and dies in Regunt. Every 
      agency houses its highest offices here in this locus of government power.
      Yet despite the proximity of government control, the city does not
      quake under the tyranny of authoritarianism. That the government
      serves its people is a well respected fact, and it is commonly
      understood that Regunt only functions at the willing 
      compliance of its citizens.
    </p><section id="R.1.2.8.6.5" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h5>Places of Interest</h5></header><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Capitol Building</span></dt><dd><p>
              A quartet of obelisks surround this domed building which towers 
              above the inner city. With architectural adornments and 
              intricacies that border on ostentatiousness, the seat of 
              Seorsus's governmental power serves as a constant reminder 
              of the nation's political and economic mastery. Here the Senate
              holds council with the Emperor, and the majority of government
              agencies also keep their headquarters within.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Grand Threshold</span></dt><dd><p>
              A gilded quarter-sphere in the north of the city contains the
              divine masterpiece through which travel using the Thresholds
              is made possible. Heavily staffed by the National Police Force and the 
              Department of Customs and Immigration, hundreds of travelers are processed daily here.
              The quarter-sphere opens to a dazzling view of the 
              Capitol Building, imposing the nation's crown jewel as the first
              and last thing journeyers see during their time in Seorsus.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">The First Capitol</span></dt><dd><p>
              Originally the capitol building during the nation's infancy, 
              Abadar's temple has since returned to its primary function. 
              Although it may not have the same prestige it once did, the temple
              has certainly not degraded in splendor. From within the church's
              golden halls the clergy works tirelessly to bring the vision of
              their forebears, the Founders, to life.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Mercantile Guildhall</span></dt><dd><p>
              Just to the north of the docks and warehouses on the Clearlake
              are a series of large but utilitarian guildhalls. Collected within
              are offices of the various merchant guilds that do business in
              Seorsus. Although the guilds would almost certainly prefer
              to be headquartered in Crent, the law requires that they
              be located here in Regunt. The cunning merchants have made the
              best of their situation, though, taking every opportunity to
              endlessly lobby in the interest of their guilds.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Seorsus University of Law and Business</span></dt><dd><p>
              In the west of the city is the Seorsus University of Law and Business.
              It is the incubator of Regunt's commercial and political
              genius and also the prime entry point to the upper echelons of
              Seorsus's political economy. It is neigh unheard of
              that prominent figures do not have some tie to the university.
              As a result, its student body does not just comprise
              promising, untested politicians and merchants, but also veterans 
              and experts from other parts of the country looking to advance
              their positions. 
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Knight Library</span></dt><dd><p>
              Adjacent to the Seorsus University of Law and Business rises the
              nation's premier repository of knowledge. From modern research 
              journals to ancient folklore, the Knight Library provides access to
              an enormous wealth of information at no cost. The Stewards
              of the library work tirelessly to expand and preserve the 
              collection, and are often seen moving like ghosts through the book 
              stacks.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Praesidium</span></dt><dd><p>
              The headquarters of the National Police Force is a sharp building supported by 
              thick columns of polished stone which stand vigil along its 
              perimeter. The majority of citizens will only ever enter the 
              public offices and temple of Iomedae within the structure. It is 
              well known, however, that the Praesidium also conceals a 
              well-guarded network of armories, archives, and barracks.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Imperial Residence</span></dt><dd><p>
              Lush, tall gardens and a host of guards keep this gleaming marble
              estate private and safe. Despite its seclusion from the public 
              eye, even here the Emperor cannot escape the responsibilites of 
              his position. A direct view to the Capitol Building cuts through
              the manor's grounds, in keeping with a law that decrees the
              Emperor's bed must always face the capitol, such that his duties
              will be his last sight before retiring and his first upon waking.

      Due to the high economic and entertainment specialties of Seorsus, it draws craftsman
      and tourists from all over the world. Unless described otherwise, you can assume that almost
      any race can be represented as either a craftsman or a tourist.
    </p><p>
      Futhermore, the nation of Krig has no discrimination against any race so long as 
      they can carry their weight in war. Krigerian bodyguards, hunters, policemen, and 
      members of any other profession that involves martial prowess can easily find employment in 
      Seorsus regardless of their racial background.
    </p></div></div><section id="R.1.3.2.3" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Humans</h4></header><p>
      Humans are the dominant race in the central cities and in the nation at large, despite the 
      generally high levels of diversity in the country. Humans native to Seorsus
      are represented in all professions, and tend to hold the majority of influential positions 
      both in the economic and political spheres. They can be found in every major city and in the
      outlying areas of the country.
    </p><p>
      Humans hailing from other parts of the continent tend to come to Seorsus for
      more specialized reasons. Farmers, clerics on pilgrimage, and visiting aristocrats from 
      Folda are all common sights. The goat-riding Vuori 
      from the peaks of Orgiluud
      are more rare, but sometimes come down to the valley for supplies or when they are seeking
      lesser or perhaps even greater solitude than they found among their people in the mountains.
      The exotic Hariq from neighboring Mughim are often employed as guides and 
      laborers, although some have left their homes to make a living as performers in Oblectant.
      Humans from Alberi are significantly more rare, but occasionally a prodigy from the 
      mage's academy or a wayward druid will make an appearance.
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.2.4" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Dwarves</h4></header><p>
      Because of the rich underground resources in the country, dwarves are frequently drawn here.
      Most dwarves hail from the mountains in Orgiluud to live with their bretheren in the 
      large network of dwarven homes that have been built under the earth. Although most dwarves
      will be living in the outlying areas of the nation, many certainly do find their way to
      the central cities. 
    </p><p>
      Most dwarves will find Crent to their liking, as the ever-open markets and vendors 
      offer a great opportunity to sell their wares and find rare materials. Some dwarves with an 
      eye for government or leadership settle in Regunt and take a post in a guild 
      or legal office. Dwarves in the legal realm tend to put their strong racial loyalties to use
      defending the interests of other dwarves, and as such many find their way into positions as 
      District Representatives. Dwarves rarely tend to have the patience for as wild a city as
      Oblectant.
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.2.5" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Elves</h4></header><p>
      Elves do come to the central cities in some numbers, but are rarely found elsewhere the nation.
      Drawn by the wealth of craftsmanship and artistic talent, elves come to display their own prowess
      and compare their works to other master artisans'. Because of this, most elves make their home in
      a de-facto elven district in Crent, where they can live in a manner closer to home while still 
      reaping the advantages of the city. Elves almost never bother with the political and mercantile
      business that takes place in Regunt, but sometimes are drawn to the lively music and performances
      in Oblectant.
    </p><p>
      Most of the elves living in Seorsus hail from from Alberi, and those that are 
      not craftsmen are most often artists or performers, members of the mage's academy, druids, 
      rangers, or clerics of Shelyn.

      The constant festivites and general excitement of Oblectant are perfectly suited to the typical
      gnome's demeanor. There they delight in taking part in or simply watching performances. While some
      rise to great heights in official groups, most gnomes find great pleasure in being street performers
      or vendors. Gnomes with an eye for business or a craving for the excitement of mercantile 
      enterprises will sometimes venture into Crent to try their luck there.
      Regunt is far too boring and rigid for the majority of Gnomes, and they are rarely seen
      there.
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.2.7" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Halflings</h4></header><p>
      Halflings dovetail with ease into the hubbub and excitement of the central cities, and
      they can be found in great numbers all over the country. 
      Artisans, shopkeepers, performers, and even occasionally politicians, a Seorsite 
      halfling's upbeat and amiable attitude is a formidable asset.
    </p><p>
      Halflings coming from Folda are often members of the merchant class, seeking 
      potential business partners. The rural, hill-giant loving halflings from Orgiluud
      are more likely to become farmers in the outskirts of the nation.
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.2.8" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Half-Elves</h4></header><p>
      Half-elves face no discrimination for their mixed origin in any of the central cities, where diversity
      is welcome and omnipresent. Because of this welcoming environment, half-elves have flourished in
      the region and many travel from distant lands to come here. They are the second most populous
      race in Seorsus. Here, their mixed origin plays to their
      advantage, and they are well suited to any role. However, many heed the call of their
      elven side and find themselves as either artisans in Crent or performers in Oblectant.
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.2.9" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Half-Orcs</h4></header><p>
      Although diversity is welcomed in the central cities, brutishness and crassness are not. Although not
      hated or feared by any means, most half-orcs simply do not fit into the lifestyle of these cities,
      and so choose instead to live in the outlying towns and villages of the nation. Those who do choose
      to live the cities tend to make their living as bodyguards for wealthy politicians or merchants, or
      as a part of the police force.
    </p></section></section><section id="R.1.3.3" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>Classes in Seorsus</h3></header><section id="R.1.3.3.2" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Barbarians</h4></header><p>
      The civilized and well-kept lands of Seorsus are inhospitable to barbarian tribes. 
      Barbarism and brutishness are frowned upon universally across the country, and
      many barbarians would find it a challenge to be welcomed or to fit in. As there are no
      naturally occurring tribes in the valley, most barbarians trace their origins elsewhere on the
      continent. In particular, they thrive in the blazing sands of Mughim and
      in the gladiatorial pits of Krig. 
    </p><p>
      In Mughim, fire-blooded Hariq are the warriors of nomadic tribes who roam 
      the desert, never staying in one place for too long as they consider it their duty to 
      safeguard their home and its culture. Though they may feel the bloodlust of battle, many are 
      pragmatists and some fund the efforts of their tribes by working as mercenaries. Others 
      may be outcasts or seekers of gold and glory looking to start a new life in a land different 
      from what they have known.
    </p><p>
      Krigerian barbarians frequently rise to great ranks in the warrior culture of 
      their homeland. There, where power and determination are revered, barbarians can live akin to
      nobility. However, feats of greatness must be constantly proven, and one can only rise so
      high without a worthy tale of one's own. To this end, many leave Krig to
      travel the continent in search of fame and honor. But for each glorified warrior, there are 
      many defeated ones in his wake, and some among them are barbarians looking to redeem their 
      names in a new land. 
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.3.3" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Bards</h4></header><p>
      As a cultural capital, Seorsus—and in particular the central cities—holds 
      performance and entertainment in high esteem and demand. One of the central cities, 
      Oblectant, is completely dedicated to the betterment and enjoyment of the arts, and any
      performer, new or veteran, will find opportunity there. From frenetic street festivals, to
      the studious halls of Bell University, to the crystalline elegance of the Dragon's Teeth 
      amphitheater, there is no limit to the passions of Oblectant's citizens. This intensity has 
      even produced a saying known throughout the nation: no great performer will forever die so 
      long as there is music in Oblectant. 
    </p><p>
      Even outside of Oblectant, a performer has many opportunities to excel. Politicians, 
      storeowners, and merchant guilds are all keenly aware of the impact a charismatic face can
      have on one's audience, and many seek the services of skilled spokesmen. Travelers, far
      from their homes, find comfort in local song and art even in a land so distant. And a rural
      life may become grim indeed without wanderers who tell tales or sing songs of grand 
      excitement and adventure.
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.3.4" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Clerics</h4></header><p>
      Although outwardly Seorsus may seem thoroughly secular and unaffiliated, its history and
      government are steeped in religion, and many faiths have large temples and congregations here.
      The temples of Abadar, Shelyn, and Cayden Cailean hold particularly strong
      political influence, and many of their clerics become officiaries in the grand courts of 
      Regunt or the wild streets of Oblectant. But for every cleric who wields the might of 
      cities, there are a thousand others dedicated to more personal endeavors. 
    </p><p>
      Clerics of many faiths, but especially of Sarenrae, Pharasma, and Erastil, roam the cities and
      countryside performing good works and aiding public services. Some heed a call to protect 
      their loved ones, and join the National Police Force—a calling often heard by the faithful of 
      Iomedae. Others still seek scholarship in the Knight Library or Bell University, or to study the 
      mysterious and powerful relic shrines that dot the country.
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.3.5" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Druids</h4></header><p>
      The bounteous lands of the valley of Multae are full of marvelous phenonmena and natural
      resources, and there is great need for those who would steward those resources correctly. 
      As a result, the druidic population of Seorsus is not just composed of local druids, but
      also of those who have traveled long distances to experience the wonders of the valley. In
      particular, the nation has a considerable influx of druids from Alberi even those of
      the reclusive Bestial Tribes. Once in the country, druids tend to pursue their own
      goals as wanderers, members of a druidic micro-community, or even as members of larger 
      organizations for—or perhaps against—the government.
    </p><p>
      The druidic micro-communities are groups of druids that tend to gather together at sites of
      particular spiritual significance. There, they tend to flora and fauna of the area and ensure
      that the site is preserved against any who would do it harm. The Three Bridge Falls Druids are especially 
      well known to locals and tourists for their protection of the Three Bridge Falls area, and are perhaps 
      more famous than the druids would like.
    </p><p>
      Druids that are members of larger organizations tend to work with a temple or the government.
      There they perform local functions such as ensuring that the harbors and rivers are 
      maintained, and giving advance warning for weather. They may also act as members of 
      committees that perform environmental advisories and studies for government projects. Not all
      organizations are so friendly towards the smooth operation of local and national government,
      however. One particularly infamous group, known as the Balancers, are publicly a pro-nature
      lobbying group, but are widely known to perform anti-civilization acts such as magically
      weakening the foundations of buildings, defacing directories and road signs, and planting 
      trees in non-designated zones.
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.3.6" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Fighters</h4></header><p>
      Martial prowess is a much sought after skill in Seorsus and those who are gifted will
      find many opportunities to display their strengths. Although there is no formal army, the
      National Police Force is always looking for those of sharp mind and strong arm to help keep the 
      peace. Because of their limited manpower, the police have learned to fight smart, and they
      employ a wide range of skilled combat researchers and engineers to develop new tactics and
      equipment. Fighters looking to earn more than the govnerment is willing to pay might prefer
      to take on the role of bodyguard or strongman for a wealthy noble or shop owner. Others still
      may prefer to take a riskier path and bring their feats to the stage as combat performers
      —masquerading their deadly arts as performance pieces or sport in the Lavender Fields in
      Oblectant. Outside of the central cities, those skilled in combat and with good knowledge 
      of the land excel as hunters or guards for villages and trade caravans. 
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.3.7" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Monks</h4></header><p>
      Monks seeking purification and enlightenment through order and community may find themselves 
      at home in the central cities. There they have the opportunity to participate as good 
      samaritans via public works. There is only one official monk sect in the nation, the 
      Monks of the Empty Cup. They are a sect sworn to poverty and truth. In addition to the good works they 
      do for the communities around the country, they also act as a counter-lobby to the economic 
      elite of Seorsus. Although there is only one official sect, many of the librarians in
      the Knight Library are monks who worship Irori. Regardless of affiliation, martial skill and spiritual 
      leadership are valued traits all around the nation. Whether as enforcers for the National Police Force,
      covert bodyguards, performers, or guides for those who wander from the path to enlightenment,
      a monk will not find herself without a purpose for long.
    </p><div id="R.1.3.3.7.3" class="mediaobject half-image"><table border="0" summary="Manufactured viewport for HTML image" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td><object data="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7b9uMyuu5dveGVfNTNqYldJZmc" type="image/svg+xml" width="100%"></object></td></tr></table></div></section><section id="R.1.3.3.8" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Paladins</h4></header><p>
      Although the nation was founded as the result of a crusade, its economic and political success
      have made the environment less than welcoming for holy knights. Paladins are seen by many
      government and mercantile leaders as unpredictable and potentially disruptive zealots who 
      might damage the smooth functioning of the nation. Even among the temples represented in the
      senate, most choose to call their paladins to other parts of the world. However, there are
      many causes worthy of advancement in Seorsus, and those who can adhere to more 
      tolerant or flexible codes will often find their efforts rewarded. In particular, paladins of 
      Sarenrae and Erastil are often welcomed with open arms for their efforts to be understanding
      and mend the sufferings of the people. Some members of the National Police Force are also paladins of
      Iomedae, and they snuff out crime and corruption with zeal—though always under the 
      careful guidance of their superiors.
    </p><p>
      But despite the best efforts of the nation's leadership to keep the zealots away, they are not
      always so successful. There are occasional instances of activism from both clandestine and 
      public groups of divine warriors who vie for greater recognition and political influence for
      their causes.
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.3.9" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Rangers</h4></header><p>
      Although the valley of Multae is relatively small and geographially isolated, much of
      its lands have yet to be tamed and its mines have yet to be fully charted. The wilds can be 
      dangerous, and as the people of Seorsus forge ever outwards and downwards they are in
      need of those who can provide guidance through the unknown perils. Explorers and hunters ply
      the forests and mountains for quarry of bear, wolves, mountain lions, or perhaps an
      Aurumvorax caught feasting on a surface ore vein. The brave or foolhardy willing to 
      delve deep into the caverns below the nation on behalf mining operations may find foes 
      stranger still, but great bounty awaits those who fulfull their duties successfully. 
    </p><p>
      In the parts of the country fresh with civilization, seasoned woodsmen and outland police 
      patrols protect fledgling villages and secure survival from season to season. And in the 
      heart of the country, those with connections to the wilds can deal in lucrative exotic pelts, 
      trophies, and other goods. For those who do not wish to exploit their talents for profit from 
      slaughter, there are many men, women, and children who will pay handsomly to see talented 
      animals and their trainers perform in Oblectant.
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.3.10" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Rogues</h4></header><p>
      Although the central cities are lawful and safe places, a rogue's talents are nonetheless 
      very useful. Merchants and politicians alike can always find a role for someone with
      quick hands and silent feet, and in a land of tourism and commerce pickpockets and con 
      artists have ample choice of targets if they're willing to take the risk. Some reformed
      scoundrels might choose to redeem themselves as bounty hunters or undercover agents for the
      National Police Force. Others instead opt to live as performers—bringing joy and
      excitement instead of aggravation and ruin. The Silver Hilt Troupe is particularly well known 
      for taking in those of dubious pasts and repurposing them to more gainful employment as 
      daring, skillful daredevils.
    </p><p>
      Outside of the central cities, rural life provides fewer opportunities for a rogue, and
      those who cannot or will not make livings as trappers or hunters often turn to criminal
      undertakings.
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.3.11" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Sorcerers</h4></header><p>
      Opportunities of all kinds can appear unexpectedly in Seorsus, and a sorcerer's 
      innate ability to instanly access the full wealth of her magical strengths is an invaluable 
      tool for responding to sudden windfalls. In the bustling central cities, sorcerers
      are valued as enchanters in crafting workshops, but they are especially valued in Oblectant. 
      There, the constantly changing environment of festivals and performances often demands
      immediate response to crazy schemes and outlandish requests. A company of sorcerers known as 
      Light the Sky! Fireworks and other Visual Effects! has specialized in this field, and keeps a sizable retinue of magical adepts on
      retainer for hire by performers in need. 
    </p><p>
      A sorcerer's natural force of personality also benefits those who choose to employ their 
      powers to further some goal beyond wealth and entertainment. Many sorcerers of celestial and
      infernal bloodlines take leadership positions both in local government and mercantile 
      operations, where they excel in bringing allies and adversaries under their sway. Others still
      choose to unleash the full extent of their potential as members of the National Police Force.
    </p></section><section id="R.1.3.3.12" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Wizards</h4></header><p>
      The vast libraries and combined cultural knowledge of the central cities are a great resource to
      many wizards, and none will struggle to find employment here. The government of Seorsus
      employs a huge number of wizards in the Department of Customs and Immigration, where they research and approve requests for 
      transit using the country's magical gates. This approval process also involves the charging of 
      keys for the gates and their tranmission to the proper recipients. In exchange for their
      services and loyalties, the Department of Customs and Immigration funds research grants for these wizards and also 
      provides shelter and workspaces.
    </p><p>
      Craftsman also value skilled wizards, and many vie to employ the best in their 
      workshops. For those who cannot afford a full time enchanter, supply shops offer the end 
      results of the creative process. Berthold's Magic Supply is a particularly well known name in 
      Crent, and they employ skilled enchanters to fulfill bulk and custom requests for 
      their clients.
    </p></section></section><section id="R.1.3.4" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>Character Traits</h3></header><p>
    Character traits are short summaries about your character's history, motivations, or 
    personality. They provide a few quick blurbs about overarching concepts for your character, and
    reward you with mechanical benefits for defining these concepts. In addition to providing you,
    the player, with ideas they also serve to help other players and the GM understand each other 
    and how the party might integrate.
  </p><p>
    You may choose two character traits at the start of the scenario. You may not choose the same
    trait twice. Combat, Equipment, Faith, Magic, Race, Regional, Religion, and Social traits are
    not listed in this guide and should be taken from other material if you wish to use them. This
    guide defines only Campaign traits.
  </p><p>
    In addition to your character traits, your party should also work together to establish a preexisting
    connection between your character and at least one other party member. Try to spread out these
    connections as much as possible between the members of the group. This will give the group
    a level of cohesion and reason for sticking together rather than working alone. Remember, you can
    always ask your GM for assistance with establishing traits and bonds between characters.
  </p><section id="R.1.3.4.5" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Campaign Traits</h4></header><p>
      Campaign traits are character traits that are guaranteed to be integrated with some part of
      the scenario's storyline. They provide you with a surefire way to tie your character into the 
      story and seed your thoughts with ideas for character motivation and history. To accomplish
      this, they are much more prescriptive than other types of traits. You do not have to choose
      a campaign trait as one of your two character traits, but if you don't you should be sure to
      discuss your character with your GM so that she can plan out how to involve your character 
      with the story.
    </p><p>
      It bears repeating that no matter what traits you choose, you should always strive to 
      establish an existing connection with at least one other character in the party before play 
      begins. Campaign traits are a fast and effective way to do this, but are not the only way.
