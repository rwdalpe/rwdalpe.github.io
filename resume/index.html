                    Off the Grid is a Blackbaud internal competition where teams of up to 4 are given 24 hours to work on any project that they
                    think would bring value to Blackbaud or its customers. After 24 hours, the teams present their projects
                    for judging. 5-7 projects make it to the final round where they are presented to the entire Products
                    division and voted on.

                    My project was a solo project for a prototype system that demonstrated real-time communication between Blackbaud web products
                    and browser clients using WebSockets.
